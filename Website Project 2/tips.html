    <h2> Tips</h2>
    <p> Welcome to Sydney, one of Australia’s most vibrant and picturesque cities. 
        To make the most of your visit, begin with a walk along the Bondi to Coogee coastal trail, offering stunning ocean views and access to several beaches—perfect for those seeking natural beauty without the cost. 
        Iconic landmarks such as the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge are must-sees, though they can become crowded, especially during weekends and holidays. 
        For a more relaxed experience, consider visiting early in the morning or late afternoon. To avoid peak tourist congestion, explore lesser-known gems like Barangaroo Reserve or the Royal Botanic Garden, both offering scenic views and peaceful atmospheres. 
        Sydney’s public transport system is efficient and affordable—use an Opal card to access trains, buses, and ferries across the city. 
        For budget-friendly dining, head to food courts in areas like Chinatown or Haymarket, where you’ll find excellent meals at great value. 
        Finally, always carry sunscreen and water, as Sydney’s climate can be deceptively intense. With a little planning, your Sydney adventure can be both memorable and economical.

    <h2> Advice</h2>
    <p> Sydney is a central bub for many tourists, there are lots, and lots, and LOTS of people. Don't worry! And don't be overwhelmed! 
        Here's some advice for you: 
        <br><strong>1. There is Absolutely No Need to Overpack </strong></br>
        Sydneysiders prefer to keep their clothing casual during the day. Like casucal dresses, stylish shirts and cloth jackets.
        It does get cold though, so it's best to pack something light or warm.</br>
        <br> <strong> 2. Book the Dining and Accomadation in Advance</strong></br>
        Much of what you will do in Sydney will depend on the weather, however, if there are specific destination resturants you <em> really</em> need to go to, book ahead, especially on the weekends.
        The best value for accomadation will be on the Australian summer months like Janurary and Feburary. This makes hotels and resturants fill up quick.
        So if you're planning to come to Sydney in the summer month time, make sure to prebook, avoiding the rush and expensive costs. </br>
        <br> <strong>3. Swim Sensibly and Don't Take Risks!</strong></br>
        Sydney's beaches are pretty and beautiful, but the shark attacks that have occured are a lot, and tend to lead to death and life-changing injuries.
