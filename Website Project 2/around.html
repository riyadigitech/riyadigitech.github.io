  <h3> How to Pay?</h3>
    <p> Luckily, Sydney has a physical travel card called "Opal" and helps with easy tapping on and of at the stations and bus stops. 
    If you don't have to access to an Opal card, you can use a contactless credit/debit card or a linked digital wallet (like Apple pay or Google pay)  The network is fully integrated with the Opal card system, so you can tap on and off just like you would on a train or ferry.  </p>

   <h3>Buses</h3>
    <p> Sydney’s bus system is a flexible and scenic way to explore the city, especially for reaching places that trains don’t cover. 
    Operated under the NSW Transport network, buses run across hundreds of routes—from the beachside suburbs of Coogee and Manly to the cultural hubs of Newtown and Balmain.

    Many buses offer air-conditioning, real-time tracking, and accessibility features like low floors and priority seating. 
    Navigating Sydney by bus is easy, affordable, and surprisingly scenic.</p>

    <h3> Trains/Metros </h3> 
    <p> Sydney’s train lines form a well-organized and far-reaching network that makes navigating the city incredibly convenient. 
    The system includes nine suburban lines—each marked with a T-number and color—such as the T1 North Shore & Western Line, T2 Inner West & Leppington Line, and T8 Airport & South Line, which connects directly to Sydney Airport.
     These lines converge through the City Circle, a loop of underground stations like Town Hall and Circular Quay, making transfers seamless.
    Trains run frequently, especially during peak hours, and the entire network is integrated with the Opal card system, allowing easy travel across trains, buses, ferries, and light rail. 
    Whether you're heading to the beach at Bondi, the historic precincts of Parramatta, or the scenic Blue Mountains via intercity connections, Sydney’s train lines offer a reliable and scenic way to explore the region.</p>
