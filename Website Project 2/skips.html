    <h1>Don't Skips!</h1>

<div class="garden">
<h3>Paddington Reservoir Gardens</h3>
<p>A heritage-listed site transformed into a sunken garden with industrial ruins, hanging plants, and tranquil walkways. It’s a photographer’s dream and a quiet escape just off Oxford Street.</p>

<div class="Wharf">
<h3>McMahons Point Wharf</h3>
<p>Skip the busy Circular Quay and catch a ferry to this charming spot. The view back toward the Opera House and Harbour Bridge is arguably better—and far less crowded.</p>

    <h3>Barangaroo Reserve</h3>
    <p>Often overshadowed by Darling Harbour, Barangaroo’s sandstone paths, native gardens, and waterfront views make it a stunning place for a walk, especially at golden hour.</p>
